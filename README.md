## Overview

Claude Dash answers one critical question: **How many more interactions can I have with Claude Code in this session?**

Unlike other usage trackers that bombard you with metrics, Claude Dash has a singular focus - showing you exactly how many prompts you have left before your session expires. Every design decision prioritizes this core mission.

**Key Insight**: Claude Code primarily enforces message limits, not token limits*. You get some number of interactions per 5-hour session, and Claude Dash helps you track what really matters - how many more you have.

*Note: Very long messages, large files, or extensive session context can sometimes reduce the number of interactions below your plan's nominal quota.

### Design Philosophy

- **One Question, One Answer**: How many prompts do you have left? That's it
- **Minimal Interface**: No clutter, no unnecessary metrics, just what you need
- **Adaptive Learning**: Personalizes to your unique coding patterns over time
- **Actionable Information**: Know when to switch to Sonnet for more interactions

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Interactions Remaining**: The ONE number that matters - how many more prompts you can send
- **Bayesian Predictions**: Statistical analysis that tells you if you'll hit limits this session
- **Model Usage Tracking**: See your Opus/Sonnet mix and know when to switch for more interactions
- **Real-Time Updates**: Always current with 30-second refresh cycles

### Why Our Approach Works
- **Focused Design**: We show only what affects your remaining interactions
- **Personalized Learning**: The app learns YOUR patterns, not generic averages
- **Actionable Insights**: Clear guidance on whether to continue or switch models
- **Zero Configuration**: Just launch and go - automatically determines your subscription plan and reads Claude's local data

### Technical Details
- **Compact Interface**: Minimal window footprint
- **Themeable**: 13 themes including high contrast options
- **Scalable UI**: 75%-200% scaling for any display
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Claude Code installed and used on your system

### Install with uvx (Recommended)

The easiest way to run Claude Dash is with [uvx](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

```bash
# Install uv if you haven't already
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh  # On macOS/Linux
# Or see https://github.com/astral-sh/uv for other platforms

# Run Claude Dash (once published to PyPI)
uvx claude-dash
```

### Install with pip

```bash
# Once published to PyPI
pip install claude-dash
claude-dash
```

### Install from source

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mhcoen/claude-dash.git
cd claude-dash
```

2. **Install in development mode:**
```bash
pip install -e .
```

4. **Run Claude Dash:**
```bash
python src/main.py
```

## Usage

Simply launch Claude Dash - **no configuration needed**. The app automatically:

1. **Determines your subscription plan** from your usage patterns
2. **Shows your remaining prompts** with ML-powered predictions
3. **Learns your coding style** to improve accuracy over time (tracks message frequency, session duration, and usage spikes from your past 7 days)
4. **Updates every 30 seconds** with real-time data

That's it. Just run it and get your answer.

Claude Dash parses `~/.claude/projects/*/chats/*.jsonl` files in real-time with no upload or cloud processing - your data never leaves your machine.

### Command Line Options

```bash
claude-dash [options]
```

- `--version` - Show version information
- `--debug` - Enable debug logging (saves to `/tmp/claude-dash-debug.log`)
- `--log-file FILE` - Write logs to specified file
- `--quiet` - Suppress all console output

### Understanding the Display

The main card shows:
- **Interactions: X used** - Number of prompts you've sent in this session
- **Remaining: ~X** - Estimated prompts left based on your usage patterns (~ indicates approximation)
- **Burn rate: X / hour** - Current rate of prompt consumption
- **Session Time** - Progress bar showing time elapsed and remaining
- **Model Usage** - Percentage of Opus vs Sonnet usage

Below that:
- **Prediction text** - Whether you're likely to hit limits this session
- **Limiting factor** - Which resource (messages/prompts/tokens) will run out first
- **Confidence level** - How reliable the prediction is based on available data

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **T**: Cycle through themes
- **Ctrl/Cmd +**: Increase UI scale
- **Ctrl/Cmd -**: Decrease UI scale

## Configuration

Claude Dash works out of the box with **zero configuration required**. It automatically:
- Determines your Claude subscription plan from your usage patterns
- Learns your personal usage style over time
- Adapts predictions based on your history

Advanced users can find configuration files in `~/.claude-dash/` if they want to customize themes or UI settings, but this is completely optional.

To reset configuration to defaults, simply delete `~/.claude-dash/` and restart the app.

### Advanced Configuration

For power users who want to fine-tune prediction accuracy, the following values can be adjusted in `~/.claude-dash/config.json`:

```json
"analysis": {
    "adaptive_bounds": {
        "simple_threshold": 3,      // Messages below this = simple pattern
        "complex_threshold": 9,     // Messages above this = complex pattern
        "pattern_defaults": {
            "simple": 3.0,          // Expected multiplier for simple tasks
            "moderate": 7.0,        // Expected multiplier for moderate tasks
            "complex": 18.0,        // Expected multiplier for complex tasks
            "mixed": 10.0           // Expected multiplier for mixed patterns
        }
    }
}
```

These thresholds affect how the app categorizes your coding patterns and predicts future usage. Adjust them if you find predictions consistently over or under-estimating your remaining prompts.

## How Predictions Work

Claude Dash uses a **Bayesian machine learning algorithm** to predict when you'll hit session limits. This system learns from your actual usage patterns to provide increasingly accurate predictions.

### For Users with Existing Claude Code History

If you've been using Claude Code before installing Claude Dash:
- **Immediate predictions**: The app analyzes your past 7 days of usage history on first launch
- **Accurate from day one**: Your historical sessions train the model instantly
- **Continuous improvement**: Each new session refines the predictions further

### For New Claude Code Users

If you're new to Claude Code or have limited history:
- **Initial estimates**: The app starts with conservative estimates based on your subscription plan
- **Learning phase**: Shows "Low confidence - Gathering initial data" while learning your patterns
- **Quick adaptation**: After 5-10 sessions, predictions become highly accurate
- **Personalized limits**: The app discovers YOUR actual limits, not theoretical maximums

### Understanding the Predictions

The app predicts whether you'll hit limits based on:
1. **Current burn rate**: How fast you're using prompts/messages/tokens in this session
2. **Historical patterns**: Your typical usage intensity from past sessions
3. **Time remaining**: Hours left in your current 5-hour session window
4. **Limiting factor**: Which resource (messages, prompts, or tokens) you'll exhaust first

**Why we show approximate numbers**: The "~" before remaining prompts indicates these are estimates, not guarantees. Your actual limit depends on task complexity - simple queries use fewer messages than complex debugging sessions. More importantly, there's inherent randomness in responses that cannot be predicted or modeled. 

**What we don't predict**: We don't try to tell you exactly when your session will expire (e.g., "you'll run out at 3:47 PM"). Instead, we answer the question that actually matters: are you likely to run out of interactions before the session ends?

**Prediction states:**
- ðŸŸ¢ **Very unlikely to hit any limits**: You'll run out of time before hitting limits
- âšª **Unlikely to hit any limits**: Comfortable margin before session ends
- ðŸŸ  **Likely to hit limits**: Current pace suggests you'll hit limits near session end
- ðŸ”´ **Very likely to hit limits**: You'll hit limits well before session expires

### Pro Tip: Model Choice Affects Your Limits

The Model Usage bar shows your Opus vs Sonnet usage:

- **Opus**: More powerful but has significantly stricter usage limits
- **Sonnet**: Lighter model with much more generous limits

**When running low on interactions**: Switch to Sonnet to extend your session. You'll get many more interactions, though responses may be less sophisticated for complex tasks.

### Confidence Levels

The prediction confidence depends on how much data the system has analyzed:
- **High confidence**: 10+ sessions analyzed - predictions are highly reliable
- **Medium confidence**: 5-10 sessions analyzed - good predictions, still refining
- **Low confidence**: <5 sessions analyzed - initial learning phase

The confidence indicator appears below the prediction and shows whether the system is using your personalized data or still learning your patterns.

## How It Works

Claude Dash reads usage data from Claude Code's local JSONL files in `~/.claude/projects/`:

1. **Prompt Detection**: Identifies user prompts vs assistant messages
2. **Pattern Analysis**: Tracks message multiplication (simple: 2-3x, complex: 10-20x)
3. **Adaptive Bounds**: Calculates confidence ranges based on recent usage
4. **Real-Time Updates**: Refreshes every 30 seconds with current session data

### Technical Details: Bayesian Prediction System

The app uses a Beta-Binomial Bayesian model to predict session limits:

- **Prior Beliefs**: Starts with plan-specific priors (e.g., Pro: 12-18 prompts)
- **Evidence Collection**: Each session that hits limits provides evidence about your actual limits
- **Posterior Updates**: The Beta distribution parameters (Î±, Î²) update based on how close you get to limits
- **Personalization**: After 5-10 sessions, predictions converge to YOUR specific usage patterns

The key insight: Not all users hit the same limits. Some consistently hit token limits, others message limits. The Bayesian approach discovers which limit affects YOU most, not what the documentation claims.

## Building

To create a standalone executable:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --name="Claude Dash" --windowed --onefile src/main.py
```

The executable will be created in the `dist/` directory.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No Claude data found"**
- Ensure Claude Code is installed and you've used it recently
- Check that `~/.claude/projects/` contains JSONL files

**"Prompts showing 0"**
- This means no active session was found
- Start using Claude Code and the display will update within 30 seconds

**"Confidence bounds seem wide"**
- This is normal when switching between simple and complex tasks
- The bounds will tighten as you develop consistent usage patterns
